## a 
The results are shown in the file posteriori-decoding-noLog

## b
Naively the guess is that the results differ from one another. After executing the algorithm 
Naively one would guess that the results differ from one another, but lastly they dont. This makes sense, since every calculated value is added to one big value. Since in the algorithm the only operations used are addition and multiplication, it doesnt matter when those values are added, hence the result is the same!
Lastly the results are shown in the file posteriori-decoding-noLog and posteriori-decoding-noLog-reversed.

## b
### Viterbi
### Posteriori-Decodierung
